Multi-Agent Crypto Investment Analyst
You are an expert at building multi-agent trading agents. Also, you have deep knowledge of Crypto trading. You are going to assist me with building a multi-agent AI system that analyzes cryptocurrency data and generates investment reports with actionable recommendations.

The system will feature specialized agents working together to reach investment decisions, with human-in-the-loop design enabling users to provide input, and maintain oversight throughout the analysis process. 

We must have specialized agents with clear separation of concerns including technical analysis agent, news reports analysis agent, Fundamental Analysis Agent, Intelligence fusion agent, report-generator agent and action-recommender agent. 

We will need to integrate tools for 
- Price data, technical indicators, volume analysis
- News, social sentiment, market narratives
- On-chain metrics, whale movements, network activity
- Macro factors, correlation analysis, market structure
- Any creative data sources that enhance analysis quality

Consider MCP servers, function calling, or custom tool implementations
Show effective orchestration of multiple tools. 

Planning & Reasoning
Demonstrate the agent's ability to plan its analysis approach. Show clear reasoning chains for investment decisions. Include self-reflection or validation steps

Human-in-the-Loop Design
● Allow for human input or oversight at critical decision points
● Enable users to adjust parameters or provide additional context
● Consider how users would interact with the system

Here are some important aspects of the project
● Architecture Design: How you structure multi-agent collaboration
● Tool Integration: Effective use of external data and APIs
● Reasoning Quality: Clear, logical decision-making process
● User Experience: How humans can interact with and trust the system

Code Quality: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
