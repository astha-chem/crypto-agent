## Final recommendation and reasoning:
### Final Investment Recommendation: Hold 

#### Recommendation Summary:
- **BTC and ETH**: **Hold** your current positions and refrain from buying more until clearer signals of market stabilization and trend reversal appear.

#### Key Reasons:
1. **Current Market Sentiment**: The cryptocurrency market is currently in a state of fear, with signals leaning towards bearish trends. While this can sometimes signal buy opportunities due to lower prices, the persistent downtrend makes immediate purchases risky.

2. **Technical Indicators**:
   - Both BTC and ETH are approaching oversold conditions but remain in bearish territory according to key indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA).
   - Prices are nearing lower Bollinger Bands, indicating possible oversold conditions, but no clear turnaround signals yet.

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Given your low risk tolerance, it is advisable to avoid any increase in portfolio exposure to BTC and ETH under current high-volatility conditions.
   - Waiting for RSI improvements and MACD convergence before making additional investments aligns with a cautious approach suited for long-term goals like retirement.

#### Actionable Steps:
- **Monitor Market Signals**: Look for signs of a price rebound and improved sentiment (increased buying interest, positive macroeconomic news affecting crypto positively).
- **Evaluate Economic Influences**: Stay informed about macroeconomic trends that could impact crypto prices, such as interest rates or global economic changes.
- **Incremental Approach**: Once positive signs of stabilization appear, consider gradual purchases rather than lump-sum investments to minimize exposure risk.

#### Confidence Level: High
This recommendation aligns with your profile characteristics and takes into account the current market context. As a conservative beginner, careful monitoring and strategic patience will aid in achieving your long-term investment goals.
