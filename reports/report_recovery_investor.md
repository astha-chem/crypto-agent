## Web sentiment analysis: 
### Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment Analysis

**Overall Market Sentiment**: Fear  
- **Fear & Greed Index**: Currently at 28, indicating a sentiment of fear, showing a falling trend over the last 7 days.

### Key Sentiment Drivers:

1. **Institutional/Whale Activity**:
   - **Large Withdrawals**: Recently, a whale withdrew 1,524 BTC (valued at approximately $171 million) from exchanges, causing a stir in the market as this generally indicates a long-term hold.
   - **Selling Pressure**: There is significant selling pressure from Bitcoin whales, who have offloaded 147,000 BTC recently. This has contributed to maintaining downward price pressure on BTC. [Source](https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoin-slides-as-liquidations-whale-selling-and-fed-caution-weigh-on-crypto-200667482).
   - **ETF Inflows**: Despite the selling from whales, institutional buyers have been absorbing some of the selling through ETFs, with recent inflows of up to $241 million noted. [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-surge-back-record-191735899.html).

2. **News/Media Sentiment**:
   - **Market Downturn**: Negative news surrounding Bitcoin and Ethereum prices (both recently fell due to government fears, and liquidations caused significant selling pressure), indicating a shift towards bearish sentiment.
   - **Regulatory Concerns**: There are mentions of regulatory pressure possibly affecting market stability. 

3. **Social Media Sentiment**:
   - Social discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit indicate frustration and concern among traders, especially amidst the decline of both BTC and ETH prices.
   - Posts reference that despite the current downturn, some traders see potential recovery in the long term, driven largely by fundamentals rather than price action.

### Sentiment Trend Direction:
- **Deteriorating**: The sentiment is deteriorating as fear increases, backed by whale selling activities and regulatory concerns.

### Risk/Opportunity Assessment:
- With the current fear sentiment and heavy selling pressure from whales, there are risks of further price declines. However, for a long-term investor like yourself, this fear could represent a potential buying opportunity if you believe in the long-term fundamentals of BTC and ETH.
- **Investment Decision**: It may be a good time to gradually buy at lower prices, considering you have a budget of $300/month.

### Confidence Level in Sentiment Analysis:
- High. The analysis reflects recent news, social media discussions, and institutional trends indicating a clear sentiment in the market.

### Recommendations for Your Investment Approach:
1. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: With your monthly budget of $300, consider spreading your investment evenly between BTC and ETH. This strategy will mitigate volatility impacts.
2. **Buy on Dips**: Given the potential continued fear in the market, wait for further dips in price to accumulate more, especially if prices near critical support levels, such as $100,000 for BTC and $3,500 for ETH.
3. **Portfolio Diversification**: If possible in the future, consider diversifying to other altcoins that might present better growth opportunities post-recovery.
4. **Stay Updated**: Continuously monitor institutional activities and regulatory news, as these factors heavily influence price movements.

Based on the comprehensive analysis gathered from the web sentiment expert, technical analysis expert, and validation from the challenger expert, here are my final recommendations for your crypto investment strategy focused on BTC and ETH:

### Investment Recommendation:

**Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Recommendation**: **Buy**
- **Current Price**: $109,607.57
- **Rationale**:
  - Current price action is near a significant support level ($109,270.08).

  - Similar fear sentiment could lead to favorable buying conditions if more institutional interests flow back into ETH.

### Overall Strategy:
1. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Continue with your plan of investing $300 monthly, evenly splitting it between BTC and ETH, focusing on the identified support levels for better average cost positions.
2. **Monitoring**: Stay alert to news that may impact market sentiment (e.g., regulatory changes, macroeconomic indicators).
3. **Re-assessment**: Regularly review market conditions and adjust your strategy based on both price movements and overarching market sentiment shifts.

### Confidence Level:
